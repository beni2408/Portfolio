                            Hi, I'm Jascar Benish — a dedicated and ever-evolving Front-End Developer with a strong foundation in building responsive, intuitive web and mobile applications using modern technologies.
                            <ul>
                                <li>HTML / CSS / JavaScript / ReactJS</li>
                                <li>Advanced JavaScript with API integrations</li>
                                <li>Flutter & Firebase</li>
                                <li>Flutter Navigation & State Management</li>
                                <li>Firebase Extensions & Cloud Integration</li>
                                <li>Git & GitHub</li>
                                <li>UI/UX Design using Figma</li>
                            </ul>
                            As a front-end enthusiast, I focus on developing scalable, performant web interfaces using ReactJS. My experience includes API handling, reusable component architecture, and working on real-time data flows. In parallel, my work in Flutter has deepened my understanding of mobile UI/UX, allowing me to develop cross-platform apps with smooth navigation and robust state handling.

                            During my internship, I’ve contributed to multiple projects including login systems, dashboard visualizations, and interactive execution flows. Each week involved working on a project with regular code reviews and collaborative sprints, building my proficiency in agile development and hands-on problem-solving.
                            <h4>Academic Background</h4>
                            
                                I hold a B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering from Karunya Institute of Technology. My academic pursuits include a published research paper on Pneumonia Detection using CNN from Chest X-rays, which achieved 97% accuracy — showcasing my interest in AI and medical imaging.
                            
                            
                            <h4>What Drives Me</h4>
                            I'm currently exploring the MERN Stack with the goal of becoming a Full Stack Developer. My learning path includes in-depth exploration of JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Tailwind CSS, ReactJS, Node.js, MongoDB, and MySQL — along with API integrations and real-world project implementation.

As I progress through each module, I’m building a solid understanding of both front-end and back-end development. I'm especially interested in how these technologies work together to create seamless, scalable, and efficient web applications. This journey is helping me strengthen my problem-solving skills, write cleaner code, and think more like a full-stack engineer. Each step in this journey is expanding my technical capabilities and preparing me to contribute meaningfully to projects that combine intuitive UI/UX, powerful backend systems, and the intelligence of AI.
