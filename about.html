                            Hi, I'm Jascar Benish, a passionate and ever-evolving Flutter Developer and UI/UX Designer with a strong foundation in mobile app development and Web App development
                            <ul>
                                <li>HTML / CSS / JavaScript / ReactJS</li>
                                <li>Advanced JavaScript with API integrations</li>

                            </ul>
                            This program is structured with weekly tests and three real-world projects every week, giving me continuous hands-on experience in building responsive, interactive, and data-driven applications. Each week, I grow more confident in both my frontend and backend capabilities.

During my internship, I’ve designed and developed multiple application features including login systems, dashboards, voting modules, and execution flows using Flutter. I’ve worked closely with Figma for UI/UX design, and contributed to building interactive dashboards and performance review systems based on data analytics.

I also hold a B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering from Karunya Institute of Technology, and have explored AI through a published paper on Pneumonia Detection using CNN from Chest X-rays, which achieved 97% accuracy.

Beyond tech, I’m a certified pianist and composer, with years of experience in live performance, audio engineering, and video editing — skills that blend my analytical and creative mindsets beautifully.
                            <h4>What Drives Me</h4>
                            I love bringing ideas to life — whether it's through code or composition. I’m particularly drawn to AI, cloud technologies, and projects that empower people through intuitive digital experiences. I'm constantly learning and love collaborating with like-minded individuals on purposeful tech initiatives.
